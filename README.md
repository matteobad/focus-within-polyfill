The `:focus-within` CSS pseudo-class represents an element that has received focus or contains an element that has received focus. In other words, it represents an element that is itself matched by the :focus pseudo-class or has a descendant that is matched by `:focus` (This includes descendants in shadow trees).

This selector is useful, to take a common example, for highlighting an entire `<form>` container when the user focuses on one of its `<input>` fields.

More information on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within).

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to use

This package is available both as production ready script and as a package. The script can be downloaded [here](https://unpkg.com/focus-within-polyfill/dist/focus-within-polyfill.js), or installed with a package manager.

```sh
# npm
npm install focus-within-polyfill --save

# yarn
yarn add focus-within-polyfill
```

When included the polyfill will auto-initialize.

```javascript
/* ES5 */
<script src='https://unpkg.com/focus-within-polyfill/dist/focus-within-polyfill.js'></script>
```

In addition this library is available as a es6 module that can be imported and bundled up with any build tool. If you are importing it as a dependency, make sure to call the polyfill method:

```javascript
/* ES6 */
import 'focus-within-polyfill'
```

After import and initialization the polyfill will kick in **only** if `:focus-within` is not supported in the current browser. By default the `.focus-within` class will be added automatically to every element that should have the pseudo-class. Additionally in the initialization fase a `.js-focus-within` class will be appended to the body.

## üìÉ How it works

This package will add two event listeners, one on the *focus* event and one on the *blur* event to trigger the automatic apply and remove of a custom attribute to indicate wheter the Element should have a `:focus-within` pseudo-class. In order to do so and be compatible with older version of IE and EDGE the `getAttribute`, `setAttribute` and `removeAttribute` methods are used to set both attributes and classes. Then `requestAnimationFrame` is used to apply the modification to the DOM.

This polyfill is compatible with native [Shadow DOM](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom#what) and with the [webcomponents polyfill](https://www.webcomponents.org/polyfills/). This means that even on IE11 and EDGE you will be able to use the `:focus-within` pseudo-class to style elements even outside a shadowRoot.

## ‚≠ï Features

* _Custom attribute/class_ value to apply the polyfill
* _Shady CSS/DOM_ support even with the [webcomponents polyfill](https://www.webcomponents.org/polyfills/)
* _Non standard Element_ support, like SVG Element with link inside

## ‚úîÔ∏è Browser Support

| Polyfill        | Edge | IE11+ | Chrome | Firefox | Safari |
| --------------- |:----:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|
| `:focus-within` | ‚úì    | ‚úì     | ‚úì      | ‚úì       | ‚úì      |

\* This polyfill maybe work on older versions of the browsers.
